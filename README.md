# Story Blocks

Story Blocks is an innovative platform that aggregates trending articles and presents them in a user-friendly fashion. It is powered by AngularJS and uses MongoDB on the backend. Here is how it works:

- API calls are made to various social media sources, gathering details for trending topics
- Trending topic data is cached in a Mongo database, to facilitate consistent client-side rendering.
- On client-side load, cached data is requested from Mongo database.
- Data is rendered on different cube faces, also allowing rotation and article expand functionality.
